# BrowseOS
BrowseOS is an experimental OS GUI built on HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery. So far I have put about four hours of work into it, and it looks pretty good. This is mostly a project for me to get comfortable with Jquery and JS, but I may use it in the future.

## Design
BrowseOS is designed to be as minimal as possible. I wanted a similar style to the upcoming "Light Phone 2", but I also wanted to make mine different. I haven't gotten very far, but it looks pretty good. There are a lot of bugs in the design that I'll be fixing soon.

## Contributions
It's just me... if you want, you can fork or whatever and do that merge thing, as long as it makes it better ill merge it or whatever. I don't remember all the terms, and I'm writing this a bit late at night, so I'll hopefully come back and fix this.

### Conclusions
Yeah, so if you want, please contribute, I would love to see how I can make this better, and hopefully make it into a fully designed WebUI (or whatever they are called. I like WebUI).
