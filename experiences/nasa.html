			<p>During the week of April 30th - May 4th, I shadowed an employee at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. This shadow showed me the opportunities and jobs at NASA. As a kid, the only jobs you think of with NASA are Astronauts, Engineers, and Mission Control, but there are so many other jobs to make the facilities and organization work. I also learned a lot about internship possibilities, and I will be applying for an internship during the summer between my Junior and Senior year.</p>
			<p>One of the most intriguing aspects of NASA GSFC was that it was very similar to a College campus. There are clubs, activities, events, and groups. There are all kinds of things to do at NASA. At one point, I saw the Karate Club while leaving one of the buildings, practicing their skills in the hallway. There is a huge community feel, and eveyone at NASA has to work together, even without knowing everyone (there are 10,000 people at GSFC alone), to keep the organization moving forward.</p>
			<p>After going to NASA, I believe it is definitely a possible career option, and because I now have contacts at NASA, I believe it would be an amazing opportunity for internships and maybe even jobs.</p>
