			<p>CommUnified is a work in progress web and mobile application designed to help classrooms with multiple languages being used. It will translate assignments, lessons, and more into each student's primary language, in order for effective communication to take place. Currently, this is very work in progress. However, you can <a href = "signin.html">sign in</a> or <a href = "signup.html">sign up</a> and start messing around with it.</p>
