				<p><img class = "fourth left" src = "../images/face.jpg">Music has always had a substantial impact on me. I have been performing music for almost six years now, and composing music as a hobby for almost four years. Through these years of composing music, I have added more and more of performance into my pieces, and Checkmate is the cultivation of this. A blend of pop and jazz, Checkmate induces a feeling of calm and relaxation uses acoustic instruments with subtle jazz fills in order to create a unique and fun song that could be performed on piano, Marimba, or by a Jazz band. When listening to Checkmate, you can put yourself in a live performance jazz club or a pop radio station.</p>
