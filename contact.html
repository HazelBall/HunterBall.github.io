				<p>Being a web and software developer, as well as innovative and extroverted, I love working on ideas with people. Especially ideas that can stand out. I am experienced at making custom websites, as well as some back end with Google Firebase. I also am great at collaberating, having worked with multiple groups in the past the create amazing websites and projects. If you are looking for someone to work with on an upcoming project, whether it be for yourself, your company, your project, or anything else, I can help you make that project a reality.</p>
