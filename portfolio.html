						<a href = "https://qwertle.com"><h5 id = "qwertle">Qwertle</h5></a>
						<p>In early 2022, I created a spin off to the popular web game "Wordle" called "Qwertle", in which
							users try to find the day's 4 randomly generated letters in 7 guesses or less. I created this
							to learn more about browser storage, UI, and most importantly to anger my friends.</p>

						<p>Fresh is a modern, lightweight web framework designed around ease of use for developers of any
							profeciency. Creating custom websites is easier than ever, and the entire framework is fully
							customizeable. Using Fresh is as easy as linking the CDN or
							<a href = "https://github.com/hunterball/fresh">downloading the project</a> from Github.</p>
