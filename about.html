				<p><img class = "third left" src = "images/face.jpg">Hello! My name is Hunter, and I am an aspiring Web and Software Designer and Developer.<br><br>I am a junior at Legend High School, in Parker, Colorado. I have been programming for just over four years now, and I have created multiple amazing websites, apps, and programs. I am currently the CFO of Fractyl Development LLC, a software and web development and publishing company I co-founded with 5 other partners. I specialize in minimalistic designs and powerful executions, to make sure brands, portfolios, projects, and people stand out.</p>
				<p>I am experienced in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Java, as well as moderately experienced in Swift and C#. I am currently learning iOS app development, as well as back end development and server side programming. I am hoping to get a degree in computer science from a respectable school, and use internships and other experiences there to further my professional abilities.</p>
