			<h3>I am a Programmer</h3>
			<p>Before I even knew how to program, I thought coding was amazing. The ability to write thousands of lines of code to create something. In sixth grade, I said I wanted to be a webmaster, because the idea of making websites was so intruiging to me.</p>
			<p>Now, in tenth grade, I can't believe how far I've gotten. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and C# and I am learning Python and Swift. I can code websites and deploy them, and I am currently using Unity to start developing Android and iOS games.</p>
			<p>Not only do I code, but design is my passion as well. Design of an app or website is the most important aspect of it. If it doesn't look good, the functionality won't matter because nobody will use it.</p>
			<p>I love front end development, but I also want to learn back end development so I can create servers and interact with them, which adds much more functionality, after something is designed and developed.</p>

			<h2>My Web Development Process</h2>

		<div class = "heading green" id = "design">
			<h3>Step 1: Design</h3>
		</div>
		<div class = "container white-green">
			<p>After getting in contact, I will design a basic template for the design, based purely around what you want, what looks good, and what makes sense, and design the exact look and feel of the website. Design always comes first, and takes around 3-5 days, to make sure everything is to both my standards and yours.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "heading blue" id = "development">
			<h3>Step 2: Development</h3>
		</div>
		<div class = "container white-blue">
			<p>After the website design is layed out, I will work for about 4-8 days developing the website. I will continue to send you updates as to the progress and pictures, videos, and test websites. If you don't like the end product, I will redesign to your liking, with no extra charge. Your website should be yours, not mine, so if you don't like it, I will redo it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "heading light-blue" id = "deployment">
			<h3>Step 3: Deployment</h3>
		</div>
		<div class = "container white-light-blue">
			<p>After the final design and functionality is added to your one of a kind website, I will work with you, whether you know exactly what web host you want to use or not, until you find the right product for you. After all, it's never good to get yourself into something you don't understand, and web hosting can be confusing, but with the proper guidance, you can get exactly what you need, for the price you want.</p>
