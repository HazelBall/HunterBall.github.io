					<h5>The Morse Project</h5>
					<p>In early 2018, I helped create an android application with some of my friends for a technology competition, designed to vibrate your received SMS messages in Morse Code, allowing you to read the messages without pulling out your phone.</p>

					<h5>Fresh.CSS</h5>
					<p>I am currently developing a CSS boilerplate/framework for small projects, websites, and portfolios. It is easy to download, use, and even  modify, and it also uses JavaScript and JQuery to create even better animations, useability, and features, to allow your website to shine without the hassle of using large frameworks with huge learning curves.</p>

					<h5>Communified</h5>
					<p>I am developing a Web/iOS application designed to help the learning curve in multilingual classrooms by translating assignments, lessons, and messages to each studentâ€™s primary language, rather than using the tedious task of translating back and forth in translation software designed for use between two users, rather than a classroom of students.</p>
