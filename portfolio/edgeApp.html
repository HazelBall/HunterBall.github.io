				<p>The EDGE App is a prototype application I designed in 9th grade for scheduling and information dissemination within the Legend High School EDGE Program. Although the application is very simple and basic, it's functionionality and benefits over the scheduling and newsletter services used in 9th grade were immense. Students were able to find all information in one place, and get to the scheduling easily without the hassle of navigating the Legend EDGE website, which continues to be cluttered and unorganized.</p>
				<p>Through this project, I gained much needed experience on logo and UI design, as well as app and web development. Although the app mostly used WebKit and directed towards a weebly website, it took a lot of work in order to make the website look good within the app. It was this project that sparked my interest in Web, Software, UI, and App design.</p>
