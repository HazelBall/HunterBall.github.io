				<h1>What is this?</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Yeah, I know this kind of breaks the fourth wall and that this isn't actually part of the experience, but if you are totally lost and don't understand any of this, please read on.</p><br>
				<p>I'll give you some heads up, if you want the real experience of this, please go to file, then click home, to take you back to the beginning of the game. This is your last warning.</p>
				<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>Almost there</p><br>
				<p>This game is a work in progress web browser game made up only of html, css, and javascript. The purpose was originally just for a project for science at my high school but I wanted to continue it. And here it is, almost done.</p>
				<br><p>The object of the game is to find the murderer/cyberhacker, using your own clues and common sense, as well as hacking abilities, and take them down. However, you realize the situation you are getting yourself into is much more complicated than anticipated. It's up to you to right the wrongs and avenge the dead.</p>
				<br><br><p>Yeah, I know, that seems way more hyped up than this actually is. It's my first interactive web game, and I am still developing it. If you really want to give me feedback, please email me.</p>
				<br><p>If you like the game/experience, please tell your friends or something, it means a lot to me. <br><br>Thanks,</p>
				<p>- Hunter Ball</p>
