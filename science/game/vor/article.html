				<h1>FBI Agent Brutally Murdered In House, No Suspect Found.</h1>
				<h2>FBI is still looking for the murderer who took Scott Leverage's life.</h2>
				<hr><br>
				<p>Last wednesday, the life of Scott Leverage was taken. A FBI agent for over 20 years and a husband and father of one, FBI is still unable to find any suspects.</p><br>
				<p>Scott was found inside his trash can. There were several missing body parts, and several gash wounds from a knife, and gunshots. Although everything for a crime scene was carried out correctly, FBI could find no evidence of any possible suspect at the crime scene.</p><br>
				<p>Many people point to his cousin, Henry, or his son, David, as Scott had a large sum of money from his career, and they could have wanted the money. However, the FBI and police declined to comment about possible suspects.</p><br>
				<p>It is rumored the FBI is looking into a possible dark web hacktivist as the mastermind behind the crime, but again, no comments were given.</p>
