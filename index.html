			<h2>Designer and Developer</h2>
			<p>I have been coding for over three years now, and my passion is Software Development, Website Development, and User Interface Design. I have worked on several websites for business and personal use, and worked on an app with some of my peers. I am currently in the works of being commissioned to create more websites, and I am trying to create my own apps.</p>

			<h2>User Experience and Design</h2>
			<p>My passion in programming is user experience and interfaces. I believe ideas are only as good as their execution, and if an app is not executed well, it will lose traction after it's initial creation. When creating projects, I always make sure to create the best possible interface or design, and if it is not as good, I will keep working on it until it is.</p>
