			<h3>What is the Revisionary Party?</h3>
			<p>The Revisionary Party is an EDGE Political Party. We fight for everyone to have a say in their education. We fight for the rights of all of us, as EDGE students, to create a better program, one that lets us create our future, not hinder it. We fight for every student in the EDGE program, not just the ones who can do everything that the teachers ask. </p>
			<p style = "margin-top: 25px; text-indent: 0; text-align: center;">Most importantly, we fight for change, because Change is good.</p>
