			<h1>We fight for the students, because the students are the program.</h1>
			<h2>The Revisionary Party is a new EDGE Political Party based around the voice and vision of the students. At this time, EDGE has been lacking to many in giving every student the chance they need.</h2>
			<h2>We plan on changing that.</h2>

				<h1>The Issues</h1>
				<h2>There are many issues that we want to help solve. If our party is elected in, we will create change and help bring these issues to light!</h2>
				<hr>
				<h3>Clear Exhibitions</h3>
				<p>Exhibitions are hard. Especially when we are only notified about how it is going to look and what we have to do a week before exhibition night. One of our goals is to create more transparency, and making sure the teachers have concise plans while we have enough time to adapt our product to the exhibition night feel and look.</p>
				<p>We want to not only know the requirements of our projects, but how we present it, because a large part of our content relies on how it is presented. If not, the presentation will not be as good.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Collaboration Room Revisioned</h3>
				<p>The collaboration room has almost always been closed. The ping pong table left abandoned. However, we want to make the collaboration room into a usable and productive space, to allow for more space, so people can envision their ideas and projects easier.</p>
				<p>The collaboration room needs a redesign. This includes removing the many chairs and ping pong table that do nothing but clutter the room. Then, we will add in different fruniture to create a more usable space where people can create things, and not mess around.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Redesigning some of the Classroom spaces</h3>
				<p>Let's be honest. Many of the classrooms are not productive. Many of us view Bucher's room as a place to hang out and sleep under the low lights. However, with the proper redesigns, we can create more usable spaces that allow us students to be productive. McCusker's room is already being redesigned, and it has added a lot of value to his room as a usable space. However, his room can't be the only one, and with the Revisionary Party, it won't be.</p>
				<p>We want to add better organization of many of the rooms. More natural light, better furniture layout. At first, we won't be able to afford very much more, but as time goes on, we will be able to purchase better furnature. We will work on cleaning up many of the rooms and making them look much nicer.</p>
