			<h3>What is FractylDev?</h3>
			<p>FractylDev is a software development group made up of five of my peers and I. We try to create apps that improve upon others or combine different features with our own spin to create meaningful and easy to use experiences. The Morse Project is our first app we have released, and allows you to send texts through Morse code, practice your Morse code skills, and play fun Morse games, all in the same app.</p>

				<p>Although I did not code the app, I coded the FractylDev website, available at <a href = "http://fractyldev.com">FractylDev.com</a>, from scratch, and was part of the online marketing strategy. The website is one of the first thing a potential customer/consumer sees, and if it is not designed well, they will leave, and not return, so it is important the website looks good, feels good, and works well.</p>

			<p>One of the most important things I learned from creating the FractylDev website is that mobile design is huge. If it's not designed for mobile, a huge chunk of your audience will not return. The FractylDev website was one of the first websites I have ever published onto the web, and it took a while for me to get the movile version right. The code is very sloppy, but it was a huge learning process for me, and many of my newer websites are even better because of it.</p>
			<p>The FractylDev website is still availble, and The Morse Project is being continually updated with new features and improvements. You can learn more about The Morse Project by clicking Below.</p>
