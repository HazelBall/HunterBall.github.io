			<p class = "two-thirds float-left">The EDGE app was a prototype application I built for students in EDGE to schedule their classes and find information about intensives and workshops. I was never able to complete it, due to my lack of knowledge of xCode and my beginner knowledge of design, but it helped me learn a lot more about design and developing for an audience.</p>
			<p class = "clear">Below is an advertisement I made for my exhibition of the EDGE App. I gained a lot of good feedback from this, and the EDGE app helped me learn about web design and led me to creating websites and applications.</p>
