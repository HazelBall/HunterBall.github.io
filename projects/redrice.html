			<h3>About The RedRice Project</h3>
			<img class = "half" src = "../images/redrice.png">
			<p>The RedRice project aims at creating genetically modified rice in order to provide more iron to developing countries and fight anemia. The RedRice project was created for the Technology Student Association, and will be competing in Nationals this summer.</p>
			<p>I was not originally a part of the RedRice project, but my friend and member asked for me to build them a website, and to join the team to work on the website fully.</p>
			<p>One of the coolest things I learned from building the RedRice project website was animations and hamburger menus. I knew how to make hamburger and sliding menus, but I had never truly worked with them until the RedRice project, and now I am more equipped to build commercial websites.</p>
